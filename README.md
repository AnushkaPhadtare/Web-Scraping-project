This is a web scraping project wherein I have used the beautiful soup library in order to scrape the data from the 3 upcoming B2B events across the world.
The data scraped is then organized in a structured format(excel files are the output).
I have created a main.py file 
In order to run the code, we just need to run the main.py file.
There are three more python files associated with main.py, these are the files in which I have scraped the data 
about the upcoming B2B events.
Each file generates its own excel file (structured format).
Libraries used: BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, re
The main.py file is responsible for running all the three python files and creating the corresponding excel files.
